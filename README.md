# train-time

#had a little trouble with this. A little overwhelmed with all the database stuff over the passed few days. After looking at the 17_timesheet solution again this morning, I want to go back over this assignment with the idea of pushing an object in mind. I'm pretty comfortable with dynamic elements in html, which is how our group originally approached the timesheet, and that was my gut instinct to approaching this assignment. 

# new pseudo code would be: 
#1. create object for each train added to schedule
#2. write object properties by caputuring user input
#3. push object with calculated times to firebase
#4. retrieve only required variables from firebase using "childSnapshot"
#5. append table row with snapshot data
